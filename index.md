## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at ...
I am currently a Ph.D student at LIESMARS, Wuhan University, advised by Prof. Kaimin Sun. I received my M.S. in Computer Technology from Wuhan University in 2020, advised by A.P. Hua Zou.
I obtained B.S. degree from the School of Science, Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications (NUPT), Nanjing, China, in 2018.

My research interest is in Earth vision, especially multi-modal and multi-temporal remote sensing image analysis. My research goal is to design original and insightful Earth vision technologies to make high positive impacts on the geoscience field. Additionally, I am interested in traditional quantitative remote sensing, including vegetation monitoring, carbon cycling, and so on.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Semantic Segmentation, Change Detection, Image Generation, Domain Adaptation
- **Machine Learning:** Multimodal Learning, Transfer learning
- **Remote Sensing:** Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), Multisensor data, Vegetation Monitoring, Carbon Cycling
